* The data in the form of CSV file, which consist of 36k entries of faces have different expressions.
* we have 7 types of facial expression in one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

* I used Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the face expression in real time. 
* I used some powerful python libraries for this project libraries like tensorflow, openCV and Flask. 
* If you want to check this out all you have do is run the main file.
